All files in this section --- with the exception of the menu choice "Test files" --- are developments by  [metcornic](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/) (theme: learn) and [vjeantet](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock) (theme: [docdock](https://themes.gohugo.io/docdock/)). 

These files demonstrate some special use cases and can therefore function as a kind of help files. I have added some special test pages to experiment with some options and to explain the usage.
