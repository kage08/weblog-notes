## Pictures with shortcodes

There is a problem of rendering with hugo pictures shortcodes in blogdown. You need to frame the doble quotes of the picture source with single quotes.

```
blogdown::shortcode("figure", src = '"/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png"', alt = "Some alt text")
```

With this workaorund pictured called via Hugo shortcodes should now show up:


```{r starting-point, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("figure", src = '"/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png"', alt = "Some alt text")
```
YEP! It worked!


## Pictures with knitr


```{r echo=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png")
```

## Pictures with standard markdown: 

Image is shown but the alt text is also shown as normal text.

```
![my alt text](/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png)
```

![my alt text](/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png)
