There is a nice table, which I should include and add my own stuff to it.

But see also 

+ markdown-file-test
+ rmd-file-test
+ rmarkdown-file-test

***

Whenever I change a Rmd or Rmarkdown file and cannot see the changes, try the following procedure:

1. Call the menu "Clean All"
2. Restart R
3. Restart the server
4. AND touch the file (or type something in it) to change the date of the last modification!
