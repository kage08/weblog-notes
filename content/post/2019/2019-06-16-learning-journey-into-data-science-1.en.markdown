Beginning with December 2016 – when in a blog entry I recommended a book on Machine Learning with R – I initiated a new personal enterprise: Learning the statistical programming language R to acquire competencies of a data scientist. With „learning enterprise, “ I do not mean to get just interested in a new subject, to read from time to time a relevant book and to look into some web-based tutorials. No, with „enterprise“ I mean a much more significant undertaking, namely to focus and concentrate several months on a systematic study for a new set of qualifications. 

I started with a nine-course introduction to data science, taught by three professors of  John Hopkins University and offered via the MOOC-platform Coursera. After I finished successfully two courses with certificates, I turned impatient with the teaching style and course philosophy.  My dissatisfaction was not so much caused by these professors or by their course design but had more abstract reasons: As an experienced adult learner, who is permanently employed and has no intention to change the job I did not need to provide evidence of some acquired general qualifications as most of the course participants did. I was instead looking for some Personal Knowledge (Polanyi, 1974), which I could combine with my own life and working experiences.  After a long time again in the learner role, I found it very strange that I had to spend much time on material arranged by other people which I  could not need and had, on the other hand, to learn stuff superficially or to skip altogether, which was very useful for me. 

To exemplify the situation more in detail: In the third course on Getting and Cleaning Data we had to learn different ways to get data into the R environment: To download it with URLs, to scrap it from web pages, to load it from Excel sheets, to collect it via an API. But – for instance – we didn’t learn how to get data from an SQL database. I appreciate that all these different methods are conceivably relevant, and as a becoming data scientist, one should know how to apply them all. I also understand that it is impossible to learn all the different use cases in every detail. But I disagree that the best teaching method is an exemplary journey through some of these potentially essential methods. A teaching strategy which would have better suited me would have been a systematic and complete list of all approaches with their pointers to the relevant R packages and supplemented with some prototypical program snippets to get started. After getting a systematic overview and helpful material for future usage of all techniques, one should have the opportunity to choose those two or three methods which are necessary to command for the particular learner.  In practical assignments, the learner should have the chance to be trained and to practice precisely those procedures they are interested in.

How to support the self-determined learner?
 
Consequently, I stopped my course attendance and started to look for tutorials, courses, and other learning material that are more useful for my needs. I have to confess that I didn’t know how exciting but also how difficult this self-paced and self-determined learning approach was, respectively is. Between us educators, we are talking routinely about self-determined learning (Deci and Ryan, 2008, 2008, Ryan and Deci, 2008, 2012), but often it is just a plea without concrete and detailed tips how to achieve it.

When we are preparing material for learners, we are restricted by the learning time of our students (measured in credit points) and have therefore to select from the available resources.  This strategy poses a problem for the self-determined learner as we as teacher decide which material is essential to learn and which not. Even if we are experienced teacher on the subject material in question and know therefore which skills are generally more in demand in real-life applications, we will always be wrong whenever some of our students have different needs or requirements.

For the design of online courses, there is an easy solution. Even if every curriculum has a reference point for the average amount of learning hours a student should need to cover a specific subject, there is no restriction on quantity for uploaded material. When we quantify the mean learning hours of each different subject branch (e.g., procedure, use case, method), then we can leave the choices to the students. The only requirement they would have to satisfy is a certain amount of learning hours. Students have to choose from a list of options in such a way that they fulfill this requirement.

Yes, my recommended educational strategy in the case mentioned above is a laboriously and hard-working solution in two aspects:

+  You need to work out all different learning paths with their answers, examples, exercises, and tests.
+ You need to provide an introductory section with a basic explanation of each branch so that students can make an informed decision.

For MOOCs with their vast numbers of learners, an industriously educational design would be economically feasible. Another advantage of the suggested instructional method is that every one of these different procedures to choose can be explained in more detail. As the various branches of the learning material form separate modules, teachers can add new methods or correct out-dated ones. With the proper design approach, every one of these modules will form self-contained learning objects that are useful in another context as well.
