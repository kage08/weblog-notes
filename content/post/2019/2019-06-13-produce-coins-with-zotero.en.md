With _Web 2.0_, we see a radical change in scholarly communication.  On the one hand, there is a growing need for researchers to be present on different web channels  (blog, twitter, youtube, and much more). On the other hand, the more traditional ways of publications in high ranked peer review channels are still prevalent.  It is difficult for researchers to meet this twofold challenge at the same time: After all the day has only 24 hours!

Especially for young researchers (so-called Early Career Researchers, or ECRs) is this situation alarming and even existence-threatening. The find themselves in a double-bind: Should they more invest in traditional ways of career planning, or is it more promising to expand and foster their internet presence?  I do not have a clear solution for myself. I think a transition period, the most secure strategy is to follow both paths.

„ECRs have both the most to gain and the most to lose from being at the forefront of changes to scholarly communications“ (Eve, 2014; St. Louis, 2015).

## Heading still missing

The only way I can think of to meet both challenges is to maximize the efficiency of _all_ career moves. One of my aims with _Open Science Education_ is to talk about technology supported new ways for research and publication to fulfill both requirements.

With the following lines, I will show you how you can help your blog readers to cite your post entries correctly and in way that they could count as a kind of publication. My suggestion is to use the free research tool [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to produce HTML code, which allows downloading bibliographic metadata of your blog posts.  I am planning to write a small tutorial on how to proceed in detail, but for now, I will just summarize the idea and the different necessary steps.

1. Download Zotero software: It is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
2. Download Zotero connector: With this browser plugin for Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, you can collect bibliographic data from the internet.
3. Practice with Zotero: If you are new to Zotero, try it out.  There are many helpful resources online,  tutorial, and videos inclusive. On these pages here too, I am going to explain some of the (advanced) features for the research process.
