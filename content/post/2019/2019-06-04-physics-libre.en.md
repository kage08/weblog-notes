This post is an interview with Michael Rundel on his physic book https://physikbuch.schule/ written with `bookdown`. Michael is a secondary-school teacher situated in Vienna (Austria). I've gotten to know him during one of my talks about R at Danube University Krems. I was happy to find a collegue near my hometown who is also working with `bookdown`.

**Question:** How would you describe the project idea? 

Building the most state-of-the-art physics book available for students.

**Question:** What was the origin of the idea?

Since my students days in the 1990ties I?have tinkered with web technology. Although I was always impressed what is achievable by combining HTML+JavaScript I never dreamed of the possibility of building full applications like [Google maps]( https://www.google.at/maps) or [tinkercad]( https://www.tinkercad.com/) by using pure web technologies. Browsers evolved from a simple Hypertext displaying applications to nearly an Operating System of their own. 
In Austria the current _digital schoolbook_ of today is basically a PDF document put on the internet. There is more possible with today?s web technology. *Much* more?

**Question:** Could you give me a short overview of the historical development and the different phases of your project? 

The idea was roughly born three years ago, when I was experimenting with the [canvas element]( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_(HTML-Element)) which I was using the first time in my physics applets, which let me abandon flash applets once and for all ? don?t get me wrong: flash was a cool tool for the time and I loved working with it, but it always felt like a workaround and it was proprietary software. Then I thought there are all building blocks available to realize such a project with pure web technology.

The following months I learned SVG/Incscape, discovered Markdown and its pandoc flavor, git and found the gitbooks project. 
Last summer I heard of the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package. The following school year I would teach a class of 5th grades of Austrian secondary school (second year of the upper school) in physics. So I decided to start the work on the project.

Right now I have roughly completed one fourth of the physics topics planned for the complete book

**Question:** Did you experience some crisis in your project work? If yes: How did you solve them? 

The biggest challence for my was time coonstraints. I managed to finish the project with sleeping sparsly.

**Question:** Were there some favorable circumstances for the project? If yes: How did you use them? 

1. First of all: I would have never had a chance to do such a project if there were not such fine Linux software tools and the combined efforts of the Wikimedia community.
2. On the technical side: I studied Mathematics and Physics, but I also have acquired some basic programming skills. This helped me to glue together some parts in the workflow of the book.
3. And finally on the personal side: First there is the love of my wife and my child. Also my school principal is so generous as to give me a share of our schools web space for my project.


**Question:** Do have supporting partners or institution?

Not many: Some colleagues at my school helped me with error corrections and recommendation on writing style.

**Question:** Do you know about competitive projects? 

As far as I know there is no such a project planned.

**Question:** What are in your opinion the most salient factors for your project? 

I want the project to be as much open and community driven as possible. So my projects aims to

- support as many devices as possible (Smart-TV, PC, Notebook, Tablet, Smartphone, E-Book Reader, Book (printed version))
- Exclusive use of open formats (Web-Browser, ePub Reader, PDF-Reader)
- Exclusive use of open standards (HTML, JS, CSS, ePub, PDF)
- Reuse of existing media (Wikimedia commons)
- Exclusive use of open licenses (CC-BY-SA 4.0, GPL 2,?)
- Exclusive use of free software (bookdown, gitbooks, R, pandoc, TeX, Inkscape,...)
- Community driven (all files on GitHub/GitLab)
- Open access and respect for user privacy (no accounts, no logins, no tracking)
- Accessible (share Formulas, sections, media on social media and learning management systems, full text search)
- Possible multilingual (switch the language, while remaining on the same topic).

There are projects featuring some of these points. I would like to see *all* of them  realized in the project.

**Question:** How would you describe the economic situation of your project (Human Resources, technology, financing)? 

There is not much to describe here: Currently it's just me working in my spare time.

**Question:** How would you estimate the sustainability of your project? 

I honestly have no idea, since this will be my first `GitHub` community project.

**Question:** What are your next plans?

First get the project in a form so that I can put someone else to it and document open issues. Then the project is uploaded to a GitHub repository.

Beginning with September I' going to teach a new a physics class of 6th grades of my secondary school. This is a good opprtunity for me to write an additional part during the coming school year.

As upcoming features are planned: a gif player for animated gif appearing the book and a drawing and annotation tool for drawing over images in the book.

**Question:** When will your project a success story? 

I consider my project to be successful if I can realize the project with all the points mentioned above and particularuly  if my students like and use the book.
