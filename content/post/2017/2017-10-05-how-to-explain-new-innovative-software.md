As a software engineer Yihui is interested to document his developments in a way that the target group could use them without big hassle. But as his target group are mostly lay people in software engineering there is a gap to overcome: How to communicate leading edge technological innovation in an understandable common sense terminology? This is not only a matter of 'pedagogical reduction' as my profession calls this phenomenon. It is also a question of transfering 'tacit knowledge', to use a notion introduced by Michael Polanyi.

Many philosophers (e.g. Søren Kirkegaard, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gregory Bateson, Susan Langer, Jürgen Habermas, Nelson Goodman to name a few) have reflected about the limitation of linguistic expressions. One proposal which could serve as an avenue of escape for this restriction is to invent a special kind of notational system. Common examples to demonstrate this strategy is chess notation or musical notation.
