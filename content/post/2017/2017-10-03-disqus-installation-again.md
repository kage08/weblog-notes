In my tutorial [How to install disqus on Hugo]({{< ref "2017-09-10-how-to-install-disqus-on-hugo.md" >}}) I have used the [hugo-academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) to demonstrate the installation process. The article was one of my first contact with static websites and I experimented with it at https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net. 

After some experiences with the academic website I looked for other themes which are using more prominent the blog function. I came up with this nice and very functional [hugo-theme-docdock](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock). Actually here on the website I have used a different code for the integration of Disqus proposed by [Yihui Xie](https://support.rbind.io/2017/04/25/yihui-website/).

In the meanwhie Yihui has suggested his approach as a [pull request](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/3639) which was accepted by the Hugo team. So I assume that in a new release we will all get this more elaborated disqus integration code in the standard Hugo installation.
