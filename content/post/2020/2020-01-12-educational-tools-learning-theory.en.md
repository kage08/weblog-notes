This article suggests a procedure to categorize the enormous amount of educational tools in the market. My approach uses a framework of three well-grounded learning theories: Instruction, Cognition, and Construction based on presentation modes (one-way teaching), dialog settings (two-way education), and collaborative scenarios (learning by mastering complex situations). As a proof of concept, I will use the [Top Tools for Learning](https://www.toptools4learning.com/) (TT4L), compiled by Jane Hart as a result of the 13th Annual Learning Tools Survey (published 18 September 2019).

Inspired by the yearly ranking of [Top Tools for Learning](https://www.toptools4learning.com/)  (TT4L) compiled by Jane Hart, I wanted to know if there are global changes or trends in e-learning over the years. The ranked list of tools goes back 13 years and is available for all past years via the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php). As a plan for analysis and for presenting results, I imagine a similar procedure as I have used in [comparing static website generators](/2019/08/01/comparing-website-generators-over-time/) over the years. 
## Inconsistencies in Hart's categories

To compare the different rankings of the educational tools,  I will need a classification of all apps/web services based on pedagogical reasons. For my purposes, the [categorizations used by Jane Hart](http://c4lpt.co.uk/directory-of-learning-performance-tools/) (see right column) is not useful:

+ It is the functionality of the tool itself, which motivates her division in different classes primarily. Therefore all categories contain the word 'tool' in their name.  She distinguishes four main types:

    1. Instructional tools
    2. Content development tools
    3. Social tools
    4. Personal (and professional) tools

+ Her sub-categorization under the four main headings is not consistent and has changed over the years. Sometimes she uses 'Content' as a fifth type, or she includes 'professional'  under the heading of 'personal tool.'  
+ Some tools are platform-dependent (e.g., Sharepoint, Keynote).
+ Even proprietary name for hardware is ranked in her list  (e.g., iPhone, iPad, SMART board instead of smartphone, tablet, whiteboard).

Another much better division can be drawn from her [beautiful infographics](https://www.toptools4learning.com/edu100/) (see below) on top tools for higher education 2019. Here Hart distinguishes by pedagogical reasons between 

+ Didactics (Formal Learning)
+ Discovery (Informal Learning)
+ Discourse (Social Learning) and
+ Doing (Studying).

Aside from the fact that 'formal' and 'informal learning' has another meaning (see the definition by the [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/lang-migrants/formal-non-formal-and-informal-learning) on formal, non-formal, and informal learning). I do not understand why 'studying' is different from structured learning in an academic setting. And why should 'studying' be linked just with the doing-bubble?
