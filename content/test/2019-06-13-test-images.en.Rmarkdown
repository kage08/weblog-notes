## Insert Image with the Blogdown Addin

1. Call the <code>Inert Image</code>-Plugin (CTRL-I)
2. Use _always_ the width and/or height parameters; even if you have to set it to 100%. This secures that not the simpler markdown format is chosen but the HTML-format.
3. Delete the *_files* part in the target file path name to prevent that <code>rmarkdown::cleansite()</code> deletes the folder with all files in it.
4. After you clicked 'Done' and the code snippets is in your file included, select the start part *<img* und call another snippet with *ii* to include the CSS styles <code>class="border shadow float"</code> for the image class.
5. Change _float_ to floatright/floatleft or delete is to center the image.
6. Add to end of the code snippet a blank and insert with _cc_ another snippet for the caputre of the figure.
7. Fill in the two required parameters: the number and caption text of the figure.
