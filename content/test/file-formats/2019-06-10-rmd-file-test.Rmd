## Differences to other file formats


+ toc in YAML header is not allowed
+ The `back astroph?` is allowed and result as  <code>code command</code>


```
    <code>red text</code>
    `red text`
```

Modify this .Rmd file and see if you could work without build_site()

* You have to use the build_site command when you changed the file without server on.
* But if the server is on, than you dont' have to rebuild with build_site()

Do a clean_site() and see if you could work without build_site()

* You have to use the build_site command when you changed the file without server on.
* But if the server is on, than you dont' have to rebuild with build_site()

{{%panel=\"danger\" header=\"Panels with header are possible\" %}}
Normally you can't use panel with header as it requires quotes. For the alert, notice and panel shortcodes quotes are not allowed. In alert or notice you can omit quotes; for panels you must escape the quotes with \
{{%/panel%}}
