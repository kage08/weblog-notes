description: How to use shortcodes for file attachments? There is a (not yed completely solved) problem with URLs.
---


The Attachments shortcode displays a list of files attached to a page.
Example :
{{%alert success%}}{{%attachments / %}}{{%/alert%}}

Weiterer Text

{{%alert success%}}Here comes text. The green panel has nothing to do with attachments. {{%/alert%}}
