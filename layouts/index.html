<p>This is my new English weblog, which I started with October 2017. It is an supplement to my German homepage.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://peter.baumgartner.name/">Gedankensplitter</a> I focus on educational design of blended learning arrangement whereas here I will write mainly about new workflows and tools for scientific research. Both sites are related to educational technology, but with this one here I want to set a special focus on reproducible research and the possible new workflows the present digital era is permitting. As the discussion on reproducible research is at the moment almost exclusively an international one I decided to write on this subject in (my poor) English.</p>

<p>I am busy learning about the many nice features of this template and how to adapt them for my need. This means to learn a lot about Hugo and its templates structure. But this is already part of the content (tools) I want to write about. Explore the many features of this website yourself in the <a href="/archive/">archive section</a>.</p>

<p>The structure and appearance of the site is still under construction, but there are already some articles you could be interested. I will add articles but on the same time I will continue to work on functionality and design of this site as a somewhat never ending task.</p>
