<p>This is my new English weblog, which I started in October 2017. It is a supplement to my German homepage.</p>

<p>In my original German weblog <a href="http://peter.baumgartner.name/">Gedankensplitter</a> I focus on educational design of blended learning scenarios whereas here I will write mainly about new workflows and tools for scientific research. Both sites are related to educational technology, but with this one I want to focus on reproducible research and new workflows permitted by the present digital era. As the discussion on reproducible research is at the moment almost exclusively an international one I decided to write on this subject in (my poor) English.</p>

<p>I am busy learning about the many nice features of this template and how to adapt them for my needs. This means to learn a lot about Hugo and its templates structure. But this is already part of the content (tools) I want to write about. Explore the many features of this website for yourself in the <a href="/archive/">archive section</a>.</p>

<p>The structure and appearance of the site is still under construction, but there are already some articles you could be interested in. I will add articles and at the same time I will continue to work on functionality and design of this site as a somewhat never ending endeavour.</p>
